# ML Data Analysis Code

## Intro

This is the R Notebook for our ML Data Analysis Code. We originally worked on this in an RScript, but will now use an R Notebook for it. The data used in this file will come from a simulated dataset.

``` {r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for data management
