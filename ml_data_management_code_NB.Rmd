# ML Data Management Code

## Intro

This is the R Notebook for our ML Data Management Code. We originally worked on this in an RScript, but will now use an R Notebook for it. The data used in this file will come from a simulated dataset.

## Download packages

``` {r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for data management
library(psych) # to analyze data and descriptive statistics
library(ggplot2) # to make some nice graphs
library(pander) # to make some clean tables

```

## Load in RScript where functions are created

``` {r include = TRUE}

#source(__.R)

```

## Download Simulated Data

``` {r include = TRUE}

source(simulate-data.R)

```
